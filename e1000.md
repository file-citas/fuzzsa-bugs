# Driver: e1000

# Not reported bugs
## 1. Out-of-bounds access

Length is controlled by the device and read in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eccc876724927ff3b9ff91f36f7b6b159e948f0c/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000/e1000_main.c#L4171.
The driver would perform an out-of-bounds memory access in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eccc876724927ff3b9ff91f36f7b6b159e948f0c/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000/e1000_main.c#L4093

Fix: Check the length

## 2. Out-of-bounds access

Length is controlled by the device in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eccc876724927ff3b9ff91f36f7b6b159e948f0c/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000/e1000_main.c#L4171.
The device can provide a value of 0, which will cause an underflow in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eccc876724927ff3b9ff91f36f7b6b159e948f0c/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000/e1000_main.c#L4234 and result in a very large length.
When the skb is allocated, there will be an overflow in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eccc876724927ff3b9ff91f36f7b6b159e948f0c/net/core/skbuff.c#L503, which will cause a small buffer to be allocated.

The memcpy will try to copy a lot of memory into a small buffer.

## 3. Double free / use-after-free / null-pointer dereference

While polling the code in https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10.9/source/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000e/netdev.c#L2680 wiil be executed, which in turn will call `e1000_clean_jumbo_rx_irq` and execute `dev_kfree_skb(rx_ring->rx_skb_top);` in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eccc876724927ff3b9ff91f36f7b6b159e948f0c/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000/e1000_main.c#L4188.

At this precise point, the e1000 interface may be closed which will execute `napi_free_frags(&adapter->napi); rx_ring->rx_skb_top = NULL;` in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eccc876724927ff3b9ff91f36f7b6b159e948f0c/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000/e1000_main.c#L2119.

Various different corruptions can probably occur.
