# Driver: e100

# Reported bugs
## 1. Device-shared pointer

An skb pointer is shared with the device.
Occurs in many places and it's a severe security issue for SEV / TDX.

Found through: fuzzing and static analysis

Root cause:
The device allocates the `cb` structure in shared memory which contains an `skb` pointer as shown in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eccc876724927ff3b9ff91f36f7b6b159e948f0c/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e100.c#L2936.
The driver stores `skb` pointers in shared structures with the device as shown in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eccc876724927ff3b9ff91f36f7b6b159e948f0c/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e100.c#L474.
The device can overwrite the pointer to trick the driver to call into an arbitrary address.
